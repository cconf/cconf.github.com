Let's do this thing! We are contacting organizers for sections of the
conference and starting to search for a location and funding.

Some conference ideas:

- C compiler implementers panel (clang, gcc, icc)
- libc implementors panel (glibc, uclibc, bionic libc)
- Hardening code with compilers and tools
- Exploiting modern C code bases
- Implementing Kernels in C (BSD, Linux, etc)
- Cross platform libraries and porting platforms
- [CCAN][ccan] the C Code Archive
- Discussion of build systems and the future of shared libraries (gyp, autoconf)
- A Hack Day that lasts three days (hey, C development takes time)
