A month ago I spent a morning putting down some rough ideas about a C
Conference after joking about the idea with [some][pq] [friends][polvi]
over the previous few weeks. It hit [Hacker News][hn] front page later
that morning so I had to make it real: it is now.

I am relying on the community to submit their topic wishlist via the
[reverse CFP][pfc]. To get your brain cranking here are a few from my
wishlist:

- [CCAN][ccan] the C Code Archive
- Building modern library APIs with language bindings in mind (e.g. [libabc][libabc])
- Concurrency in modern C (e.g. [thread annotations][lwn])
- Fast build systems for large cross platform code bases (gyp, autoconf, ninja, etc)
- Hardening/exploiting modern C code bases
- Hot new stuff coming to LLVM and GCC
- Cross platform libraries and porting platforms
- Keynote by someone implementing large systems in C (samba, python,
  ruby, etc)

[Whats your wishlist?][pfc]

Why create C Conf? There are new tools, libraries and compiler features
coming into the C ecosystem constantly but discovery can be hard. I want
C Conf to help. And to that end all of the talks will be recorded and
made available freely after the conference.
